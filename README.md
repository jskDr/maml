Welcome to MAML - Molecular Applied Machine Learning

This repository is a collection of tools which aim to improve the interface between computational chemistry and machine learning.

### How do I get set up? ###

Setup is easy - above standard packages (numpy, scipy), we only have the dependency of Theano, which installs with pip 


However, if you want to use the functional (multi-process) neural network code, you need to have python 2.7.8 or higher.  We recommend doing this by installing anaconda

### Contribution guidelines ###



To contribute to this code, you should be prepared to be asked to provide some of the following:

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Documentation

### Repository Tranisition ###

This repository is in transition from Bitbucket, and we are taking the opportunity to clean things up.  New features are coming thick and fast!


### Who do I talk to? ###
